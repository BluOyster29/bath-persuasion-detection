How are you?\nPersuader: I am doing relatively well and fine. \n\tPersuadee: What kind of person are you?\nPersuader: Well, I believe that overall I am good person with a great drive to do as much for people in general.  Many have said that I am a giving and kind person.\n\tPersuadee: What kind good things do you do for people?\nPersuader: Well, I basically help individuals who are closest to me by helping the elderly with very tasks locally.  I also have a tendency to help children around my neighbor by mentoring some.  I also help with my local congregation by a Godly person as well.\n\tPersuadee: You sound like a very nice and charitable individual.

We are asking for any kind of monetary donation that you may have to help with the cause.\n\tPersuadee: I believe that helping children is a noble cause. How would my donation help these children? \nPersuader: Well, your donation would help on so many levels.  Your donation will help to the overall betterment, improved health, education, and safety of many of these children who come from a developing country.\n\tPersuadee: Why should I help these children? Are they not already being helped?\nPersuader: Well, let me say this.  The children in these countries would like to have additional money provided because still in our modern day, it is still not enough to help.  That is one of the reasons why we are asking for more help.  There are many stories of children who have died from hunger but additional donations would be able to help to quell some of these isolated instances.\n\tPersuadee: That is very compelling. How much of a donation are you asking for?\nPersuader: Well, any amount that you would like to offer would be greatly appreciated.  We like individuals to give from a joyful heart.  So whatever amount that you offer would be greatly appreciated and highly respected by our organization, the Save the Children fund.\n\tPersuadee: I have donated a lot this year to charity but I am able to spare $1 if it means helping children.", "label": [[185, 288, "6-SOCIAL-OTHER"], [288, 338, "6-SOCIAL-OTHER"], [406, 511, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [512, 590, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [591, 656, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [764, 804, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [805, 834, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [834, 908, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [997, 1026, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1027, 1064, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1064, 1095, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1095, 1170, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1253, 1287, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [1287, 1358, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1359, 1448, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1566, 1617, "3-EMOTION-PROMISE"], [1617, 1768, "3-EMOTION-ALTERCASTING"], [1861, 1884, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1884, 2027, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [2028, 2089, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [2089, 2239, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [2331, 2408, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [2408, 2458, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [2457, 2590, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"]], "idx": "903"}

{"id": 2414, "data": "Persuader: Hello, how are you today?\n\tPersuadee: Great! How are you? How is your weekend going?\nPersuader: Not too bad. I'm excited to be volunteering my time to raise money for a children's charity. It's called Save the Children. \n\tPersuadee: that's great that you volunteer. what kind of activities do you do for the children?\nPersuader: Mostly what I do is try and encourage people to donate what they can to the cause. Save the Children has been around since 1919!  The funds are used to promote children's rights, better their education and health care and also provide emergency aid in situations of natural disaster. \n\tPersuadee: do you know what countries they primarily donate to?\nPersuader: Actually, there a huge number of countries that are helped by Save the Children. It's an international organization. Some of the countries include the U.S., Uganda, Kenya, Peru, and Cambodia. \n\tPersuadee: that is great. i heavily support organizations that help our own united states.\nPersuader: Did you know that, even one year after the destruction caused by hurricane Harvey, Save the Children is still present in Texas helping children to fully recover? It's truly a blessing what they do. Money also goes to provide shelter.  Just 77 cents a day can provide shelter for a refugee family. Do you think Save the Children is a cause that you would consider donating to?\n\tPersuadee: wow I'm heappy to hear that. It's wild the devastation that hurricanes do.\nPersuader: In 2017, 155 million children were helped. There's always more to do though. How would you feel about helping Save the Children by donating some or all of your payment from this task?\n\tPersuadee: i would be willing to donate 10 cents. My charitable donations budget is small because I do a great deal of donating to animal organizations. I love the italian greyhound rescue.\nPersuader: Even 10 cents is helpful. Thank you! That's great that you donate to animal charities. I support PAWS Chicago too. \n\tPersuadee: the snamils need our help just as much as the children do. \nPersuader: No doubt! I just heard about a country does not kill rescue animals in shelters. So every shelter they run is a no-kill shelter. Have you heard that?\n\tPersuadee: i didn't know about that. great to hear it! hopefully more will do the same. I have a 5k to run tomorrow for the italian greyhounds. all proceeds go to the animals.\nPersuader: Good for you! Wow, that's great!  It's nice when volunteers can act in other ways in addition to giving money. Especially since not everyone has the money to give. \n\tPersuadee: right. I like to donate my time in addition to money. charitable giving is a good thing to do.\nPersuader: Well thank you for offering 10 cents from this task to Save the Children. I will look into your charity as well and see what I can do to help. It's been nice talking with you.

Vulnerable children in poverty. Denied an education. Forced to flee violence. Orphaned, abused, abandoned. Children with no reason to smile. No hope for the future.  The world's children deserve better.\n\tPersuadee: is there any cons to donating\nPersuader: For donor, there is no direct cons to donating. However, through the power of Sponsorship, you help ensure a child in need has the best chance for success _ with a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Our innovative Sponsorship programs address the unique needs of children where they live.\n\tPersuadee: is there a minimum amount that i must donate \nPersuader: No, there isn't. It all depends on your generosity and financial ability. So would you like to donate?\n\tPersuadee: yes as a matter of fact i wish i could donate my whole life savings but that is not the case but i can donate  $0.25\nPersuader: That is indeed very kind of you for making this donating decision.

Would you like to hear about Save The Children?\n\tPersuadee: What is it?\nPersuader: It is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: Sounds like a good organization\nPersuader: I assure you that it is a wonderful organization! Your donation would be essential to help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.\n\tPersuadee: Is this the charity that they want us to donate?\nPersuader: Yes, we would be ever so happy if you want to donate to this charity. Your donation would go to a very trustable fund.\n\tPersuadee: I would love to donate.\nPersuader: Fantastic! What is an amount you are comfortable donating?\n\tPersuadee: Is this a mutual donation, from both of us.  Or do you represent the charity?\nPersuader: I am representing the charity and I am hoping that you will consider donating directly from your task payment. You can choose any amount from $0 to $2. Of course, Your $2 would make the most difference to these neglected children.\n\tPersuadee: I am willing to donate $1.  That seems to be fair to all.\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your generosity! The children of our organization will be so fortunate and happy to receive this. So many of these children are living in war zones in undeveloped countries. They face violence every day. 1,000 children were killed in the first 2 months of 2018. If you consider increasing your donation to $2, this will help DOUBLE the amount of children and our charity will match your donation at that level!\n\tPersuadee: I think I will stick to the $1.  That would make me happy to help.\nPersuader: We are so happy that you are helping as well. The children will really benefit from this. Last year, many children died from hunger because we did not get enough donations to fully feed their families. Even small amounts of change can mean the difference between life or death for the little ones. Is there any way you could consider going to $1.50? I just spoke with my manager and wonderful news! She said the charity would STILL be willing to match if you go up just that small increment!\n\tPersuadee: I love helping the children.  If you would consider the matching that amount of the $1, that would double the donation of $2 .\nPersuader: I will have to check with my manager. In the meantime, can I confirm your donation of $1 to our charity?\n\tPersuadee: Absolutely, I am glad to be able to participate for such a worthy cause.

I haven't heard about that organization\nPersuader: Save the Children is an International organization that ensures children's right to health, safety and education.\n\tPersuadee: Oh thats's amazing! Do doctors/nurses/teachers/etc. volunteer in order to provide services to the locations that the organization operates in?\nPersuader: Save the Children is supported by all sorts of volunteers, including people like yourself who make small cash donations.\n\tPersuadee: Do they hold fundraisers like some of the other big name charities that tend to draw in celebritiries and other famous figures?\nPersuader: They conduct relief efforts; they are preparing now to help children in Hawaii? I am not certain of all the ways they raise money though; I know they depend a lot on small donations.\n\tPersuadee: What issue(s) are going on in Hawaii that requires them to go there and provide aid?\nPersuader: Hurricane like conditions; the Big Island just got thirty inches of rain.\n\tPersuadee: Wow, I'm surprised I didn't hear about that! Are they still operating in Puerto Rico? I know they are still rebuilding\nPersuader: Yes, it is Hurricane Lane. I cannot imagine how scary it would be for a child to experience that type of weather. I am not sure about the specifics regarding Hurricane Maria, but Save the Children touches children's lives in a positive way all over the world. 155 million so far.\n\tPersuadee: Thats incredible. Are there setbacks due to politics or government interferences when going into certain countries? \nPersuader: I am sure they encounter many roadblocks; that is why they are so donation dependent.

You can choose any amount from $0 to all of your payment. \n\tPersuadee: I'll donate $0.10 from my earnings to Save the Children\nPersuader: Thank you. Every little bit helps.

Does the government at least give them some food?\nPersuader: i think they may donate some but not very much ,its so many people and chrildren going without ,starveing and going hungrey and the women over there keep getting pregnate with them knowing this its a shame\n\tPersuadee: It sounds like they could benefit from contraceptions.\nPersuader: yes or maybe a tube clap surgrey.or something.they are just presious little kids that didnt ask to be brought in this world but they here and needs to be cared for and loved.\n\tPersuadee: Are they being adopted or staying with their parents?\nPersuader: well i think the way it gies is that u can send money to this place called save the chrildren and they let u oick a girl or boy and the money you send will go toward there food clothing and school.\n\tPersuadee: That's nice.  How do you know if the money will really go to the children and not just people who work for save the children?\nPersuader: they send you pictures of the child like every two weeeks .and they keep you up dated on the child.\n\tPersuadee: Nice, then you can see it grow up.

That sounds a sweet deal, it would probably cost them more to send all the photos though.\nPersuader: so i hope you make a good desion on helping the chrdlern,we be weighting for your response thank you.\n\tPersuadee: I'm not so sure, there is a lot of typos in your sales pitch, and if I really donated 1 penny it would cost you more to mail me pictures than I would be sending you.  Also it seems like there would be a set amount per child.  I feel like I am being scammed for my hard earned money.\nPersuader: no mam no scam you can pay as little as two dollers.its are moral responisibility to help these kids so pleas i ask of you mam please consider makeing a dothion right now please dont weight every min a child is dieing of hunger", "label": [[127, 250, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [867, 914, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1120, 1317, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1526, 1566, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [341, 436, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [584, 789, "3-EMOTION-STORY"], [914, 1042, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1467, 1526, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1666, 1743, "6-SOCIAL-OTHER"], [1743, 1781, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1851, 1898, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [1981, 2236, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [2492, 2594, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [2901, 2916, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [2916, 2953, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [2953, 3001, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [3001, 3071, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [3071, 3128, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"]], "idx": "921"}

I just got in to work so we will see how things go today!\nPersuader: Hopefully it will be a good day :) Do you mind if I ask what kind of work you do?\n\tPersuadee: I actually work for a local television station in the middle of America.\nPersuader: Oh wow that sounds fantastic! Were you ever involved in raising awareness about social issues? Like children in need?\n\tPersuadee: I've donated to a few charities before, but I've never been personally involved myself.\nPersuader: I think you have a great platform for raising awareness so more people can donate to the cause\n\tPersuadee: That's true. I supposed I am in a good position. Unfortunately, I kind of just have a desk job, and don't really have anything to do with the news that is broadcast.\nPersuader: Well nothing is lost there, you can maybe persuade some co-workers to bring it up higher in the chain. A few years back I was in India and even though I was mesmerized by the beauty of its rich culture I was overly sad to see many children in the streets who looked utterly malnutritioned and were begging in the streets. It broke my heart. So much so that I got involved with a few charities to help children around the world.\n\tPersuadee: Oh that's great!! I wish I had more time to travel and more money to give. I love the feeling when you know you're actually helping someone else.\nPersuader: Its a great feeling. Especially now that I myself am a parent, I get even more depressed to see that in 2018, there are millions of children who suffer especially those in war zones. But you know, every little cent helps. You don't have to give hundreds or thousands. I have also worked in Baghdad during the war, and there were children in the streets selling packs of gum just to get a few cents here and there so they can survive.\n\tPersuadee: Oh my God. That's truly awful to know that children have to experience that. I would love to find a way to donate, even if it was just a little bit.\nPersuader: Have you heard of \"Save the Children\" Charity? They do amazing wo? It only takes 77c a day to help provide shelter for refugees. They have many programs that you can participate in to help out.  \n\tPersuadee: Oh that's awesome!! What kind of programs do they provide?\nPersuader: They target many causes. They provide education to teach children important skills. They also provide the best health and nutrition programs. They have a protection program and even programs for natural disaster areas. Imagine if 77c a day can provide shelter what would $1 or $2 dollars do?\n\tPersuadee: That's such a good point. Unfortunately, I'm in a really bad position monetarily right now. Is there any way I could donate even just a little bit?\nPersuader: You are very kind, but like I said every little thing helps. How much would you feel comfortable to donate to the charity?\n\tPersuadee: Maybe 20 cents? I know that's not a lot, but it's all I can afford for the next couple days.\nPersuader: Can you make it maybe 77c? Atleast you will feel good knowing that you are helping in providing shelter to these poor refugees.Your donation will be direclt deducted from your task payment but imagine what 77c would do for a child with no home...\n\tPersuadee: OK, I can donate 77 ceents\nPersuader: Perfect!!!!!! Thank you so so much! Imagine what a great gift you have just provided. May you be blessed always! And I hope, one day you will be able to raise awareness and have more people join in with the cause to save the children.

I like to donate a little bit to them from time to time, not much mind you, I don't really have or make a lot of money, but it's nice knowing I can contribute at least a little something. Anything that can help. Sometimes it can really brighten my day knowing I might have helped someone. Would you consider making a small donation from a portion of the HIT completion compensation, something as little as .10 cents?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I can make a small donation. I will do $0.20.\nPersuader: That would be awesome! Anything from $0.10, $0.20, $2.00... anything would make a difference with this wonderful organization. Every contribution counts. You're helping make a difference in a child's life an helping to end suffering. Thank you for your generosity!\n\tPersuadee: Glad to donate the charity\nPersuader: I will match your donation of $0.20, making it a donation of $0.40, that way it mill go further. It's always great to help out when you can. Thank you again for your pledge of $0.20, it is greatly appreciated.\n\tPersuadee: Your welcome, have you been a MTurker for a while? \nPersuader: I have, I have been one for about 2 years now. I come on every once and a while and do it part time. I like to call it picking up nickels and dimes. How about yourself?\n\tPersuadee: I have been doing it since January. I find some these HITs very interesting.\nPersuader: Yeah, they can be really fun and fascinating. I ike doing some of theses surveys then hearing the results later on, passively, since I don\\'t really know at the time of doing them what they\\'re for really. It\\'s fun to say, \"Hey, I participated in that study\"\n\tPersuadee: Yeah I like doing the Product review type HITs and the ones where you have to watch a video  \nPersuader: Those are pretty good. My favorite one so far has been recording my voice saying various words for a study on accents in speech. Then hearing the results on a news story about 6 months later... pretty satisfying.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds interesting. I try to do between 5 and 10 hits a day.\nPersuader: Coll talking to you, thanks for doing this hit with me today. It was awesome!\n\tPersuadee: Your welcome, maybe will do this again on some other HIT", "label": [[320, 441, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [521, 553, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [640, 727, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [553, 640, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [727, 786, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [786, 842, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [946, 970, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [970, 1126, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1126, 1314, "6-SOCIAL-OTHER"], [1314, 1338, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1338, 1415, "2-NEGOTIATE-REWARD"], [1415, 1542, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1617, 1640, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1640, 1744, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1744, 1771, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1771, 1851, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [1932, 2028, "2-NEGOTIATE-RECIP"], [2029, 2073, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2073, 2141, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"]], "idx": "928"}

I remember Penelope Cruz was in one of their commercials holding a baby if that means anything\n\tPersuadee: if she was in a commercial this must be a legitimate charity, i heard that they are helping Hawaii now with food and other things. \nPersuader: I've heard of them from way back when I was a kid myself. \n\tPersuadee: you will donate in todays charity? or i just have to donate?\nPersuader: I would donate the hypothetical money.

{"id": 2440, "data": "Persuader: Hi, have you ever heard of the charity \"Save the Children\" before?\n\tPersuadee: No I havent, please tell me more.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world  \n\tPersuadee: That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.\nPersuader: Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that\n\tPersuadee: So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?\nPersuader: Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  \n\tPersuadee: I feel so silly! Is \"Save the Children\" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching\nPersuader: Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.\n\tPersuadee: Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough\nPersuader: Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.\n\tPersuadee: Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?\nPersuader:  URL here you go\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?\nPersuader: I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club\n\tPersuadee: oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.\nPersuader: Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.\nPersuader: I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. \n\tPersuadee: That makes a lot of sense. Thank you for sharing this with me, I will definitely look more into this charity!\nPersuader: Great happy to help!

I thought it was an interesting idea. Plus sometimes I\\'m just lazy and that\\'s an easy uncomplicated way to do it.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, i do like that concept. However, I often wonder what a big difference it would really make\nPersuader: Remember that ice bucket challenge thing that was super popular a while back? I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.\n\tPersuadee: Oh wow, I never knew that! That is amazing what a difference we can make without thinking it would really make one\nPersuader: I know and besides it got my son to dump a bucket of ice water on himself which was just hilarious.\n\tPersuadee: That is funny! Honestly, before the challenge I never even heard about ALS, so I guess it did its job by spreading awareness\nPersuader: That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way. \n\tPersuadee: Yea, maybe more challenges can be done to spread awareness to diseases that often go unnoticed or unheard of\nPersuader: Yeah, maybe, people just need information, ease of donating, and a sense of community about it all. This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away. I've worked overseas with kids through medical clinics and have seen how far what we think of as a small amount of money can really go.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I am willing to donate a portion to the charity\nPersuader: I was going to donate half of mine. Some for me for the work and some for them in the hopes it helps.  How much would you like to donate to Save the Children out of the payment?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I would like to donate .75 towards the foundation\nPersuader: Brilliant. That's so kind of you. Between us both I hope it helps. And I love that they are giving their money to something other than profit, you know?\n\tPersuadee: Yes!

Would you like to know more about what they do?\n\tPersuadee: I think I'm okay. No need to share more information\nPersuader: I understand and I do not want to take up too much of your time. But please know that this organization ehlps children on every continent but Antartica. \n\tPersuadee: Why not Antartica?\nPersuader: There just isn't the population to warrant it. The climate is not sustainable for human life and children do not reside there. But in the other countries they provide emergency response, global advocacy,  literacy, and health education. \n\tPersuadee: Well that's disappointing. What country receives the most aid?\nPersuader: It is spread out by need but rest assured that their charity ranges from Kentucky all the way to Kenya. Also, 86% of all expenditures go to program services so everyone that donates knows that their money is being used for a good cause rather than misappropriated. \n\tPersuadee: Okay sounds interesting. How do people donate to the charity?\nPersuader: You can visit their website or I can assist you with donating today. Can I ask if you have ever donated to a charity before?\n\tPersuadee: Yes I have in the past, but not recently\nPersuader: Glad to hear it. Charity is very important. Is this a charity you believe to be doing a good thing based on the information I have provided?\n\tPersuadee: Sounds like a good mission, but I probably won't be able to donate\nPersuader: Any little bit helps. Even a dollar or less can be used to do great things. Small donations add up quickly. \n\tPersuadee: Yes, I've heard that before.

We specialize in providing aid to children in war torn countries.  Would you be interested in making a donation?\n\tPersuadee: That's admirable, but I wouldn't be interested in making a donation at this time,\nPersuader: I completely understand.  It wouldn't be much.  Every little bit counts.  In the first two months of this year alone 1000 children were killed or injured due to violence in developing nations.  All were asking for is a $2 donation to ensure that children affected can get access to the resources they need to live a healthy and prosperous life.\n\tPersuadee: Sorry, but no. That sucks for them and everything, but I have like 4 cents in my bank account so every little bit counts for me right now too\nPersuader: These children live on less than that every month.  Its less than the cost of a cup of coffee at your local Starbucks. Think about it, for just $2 you can bring security to a child in war torn Syria.  Im sure you could find $2 in your couch cushions.\n\tPersuadee: i don't even have a couch honestly. I can't donate.\nPersuader: And neither do these children. We arent asking for much.

You can't start spending on buying food, putting up shelter, and giving kids what they need without starting with the base. There are children across the world right now who need school supplies for education that we take for granted with it starting up again soon! \n\tPersuadee: So what percentage of the donations actually goes to the kids?\nPersuader: There is an inital upfront cost of building the base for our organization in a location, and then the majority of costs are aimed towards helping the kids in that area. I don't have an exact percentage. The main idea here is that you're willing to help people who are in need. I urge you to consider donating a part of your reward for this HIT towards Save The Children.\n\tPersuadee: I can donate 20 cents.\nPersuader: You would be helping out a great deal.

It doesn't take much to make a difference.\n\tPersuadee: ok. than how is you family\nPersuader: Family all grown up. Many Americans don't want to donate because they think that organizations like these only help other countries that are poor. This group helps poor underprivileged children in the US too.\n\tPersuadee: oh ok. i love children's very much. so i donate that charity \nPersuader: You will? That's great.

That means a large part of the donations go to the cause. \nPersuader: Yes, the breakdown that they advertise on their website also spells out where the funds go which is helpful. I'm very cautious when it comes to donating because I don't want my money misused.\n\tPersuadee: I feel the same way. If to much money is going to the administrators that is not good. \nPersuader: Yes, sort of defeats the purpose in my opinion. So are there any other questions I could answer for you before you decide how much you'd like to donate?\n\tPersuadee: Where does the money go? What countries?\nPersuader: So right now the organization is in 120 countries, which is pretty incredible. It goes to many many things, such as, shelter for refugee families, healthcare - funding hospitals and programs, education - funding schools and programs, food/shelter options...\n\tPersuadee: Alright, that is a lot of help for children. What comes next? How much do people donate?\nPersuader: So people donate anywhere from just a few cents to as much as they possibly can given the fact that the money is well used.

Do you have any questions about Save the Childen?\n\tPersuadee: I'm sorry as of today I don't have any money to donate due to my financial situation.\nPersuader: I completely understand. I'm sure that you have a lot on your plate being a single parent. And raising kids is so expensive.  Even small amounts can go a long way.  Would you even being about to spare some change?\n\tPersuadee: I I could I would but unfortunately I don't have anything.\nPersuader: If you did have money, would you donate to a charity like this one?\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I would I wouldn't mind helping someone in need. \nPersuader: That is good to hear. Hopefully when you think about receiving your bonus today, you can think about the good that you could do with a small amount. What you might spend on a candy bar or can of pop could do a lot to help a kid in need. I hope you reconsider.\n\tPersuadee: Yes , when I usually have I will give unfortunately my situation right now doesn't allow me to . I'm sorry.\nPersuader: Well I hope you have a great weekend. You have a lot to be thankful for. Nice talking to you.\n\tPersuadee: Nice speaking with you have a good day.", "label": [[134, 204, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [204, 229, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [379, 412, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [412, 487, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [487, 532, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [531, 605, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [829, 857, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [797, 829, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [990, 1055, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1054, 1088, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1088, 1145, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1145, 1224, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1224, 1268, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [1267, 1313, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1433, 1458, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1458, 1522, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1611, 1708, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1523, 1610, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1708, 1757, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1867, 1891, "4-LOGIC-CONCEDE"], [1891, 1958, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1958, 1993, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [1993, 2032, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1891, 1958, "1-RAPPORT-FRIEND"], [2032, 2080, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [2163, 2230, "3-EMOTION-ALTERCASTING"], [2309, 2330, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [2330, 2458, "3-EMOTION-ALTRUISTIC"], [2458, 2545, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [2545, 2568, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [2738, 2773, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"]], "idx": "954"}
{"id": 2462, "data": "Persuader: You know, there is a charity called Save the Children.  It's a great charity and supports kids.  Even a few cents helps.\n\tPersuadee: Hi, yeah I have heard about this charity and will be considering making a donation to them.\nPersuader: That's great! Save the Children is an international non-governmental organization that promotes children's rights, provides relief, and helps support children in developing countries.\n\tPersuadee: I was thinking about making a donation of about 30 cents to the organization.\nPersuader: That would be great.  Right now, there is still a lot to do in the aftermath of Hurricane Maria and small donations will help a lot of children and their families. We all have a responsibility to help.\n\tPersuadee: Yes I agree it is doing gods work and makes a difference to make even a small donation to them.\nPersuader: How much money do you spend on unnecessary things like snacks or candy? Money can be used in more meaningful ways.\n\tPersuadee: only about 5-10 dollars per two weeks. I am more of a healthy eater. I have to watch my diet too.\nPersuader: Every little bit helps, but for the price of a dollar a day, you can sponsor a Save the Children child in need in the US or abroad.\n\tPersuadee: Yes I agree, money should be used for more important issues.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a reputable organization; more than 90% of their money goes towards the children they are helping, so you can also be confident that your money is going where it should.\n\tPersuadee: i heard that they are very legitimate. I am definitely making a donation to help them of 0.30 cents.\nPersuader: That sounds great! The organization helped more than 157 million kids last year and your donation will help one of them. Do you know how to donate?\n\tPersuadee: sure do. I plan on making the donation after this study is completed.\nPersuader: OK.  Your donation will be directly deducted from your task payment, and you can choose any amount, all the way up to $2, if you want to donate more than 30 cents.\n\tPersuadee: yeah I I know I can. I might consider also making a larger donation to 0.50 cents. but I think 0.30 cents is adequate to help out some of the children.\nPersuader: Well, anything helps. The research team will collect all of the donations and send them to Save the Children.\n\tPersuadee: ok. that sounds legitimate to me. I want to help children and make my money go to good use.\nPersuader: Small donations will help a lot of childrens and their families and your donation will certainly help.\n\tPersuadee: any means to be helpful and make a difference in others lives is what I care about the most.", "label": [[11, 66, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [66, 107, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [108, 131, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [261, 430, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [532, 554, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [554, 696, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [695, 733, "6-SOCIAL-OTHER"], [853, 924, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [925, 967, "3-EMOTION-GUILT"], [1089, 1220, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1305, 1495, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1619, 1639, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1639, 1741, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [1741, 1767, "2-NEGOTIATE-REMIND"], [1866, 2024, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"], [2199, 2222, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [2222, 2309, "5-AUTHORITY-CREDENTIALS"], [2425, 2527, "3-EMOTION-PROMISE"]], "idx": "955"}
{"id": 2463, "data": "Persuader: Hello, have you heard of Save The Children?\n\tPersuadee: I think so, it sounds familiar. it is a nonprofit charity if i recall. What exactly do they do?\nPersuader: Save The Children helps kids from around the world by taking contributions from generous patrons. Kids from countries that have been stricken by poverty, violence, and other blights.\n\tPersuadee: What countries has the charity worked in recently? \nPersuader: Well, we have programs set up in 120 countries in total right now. Some of our most recent campaigns involve Myanmar - in Rohingya where parents and their children have been forced to flee because of violence to surrounding countries. In the largest refugee camp stationed in Bangladesh, there are an estimated 915,000 children and adults taking shelter.\n\tPersuadee: Wow that sounds like a really robust program. How long has Save the Children been around?\nPersuader: It was founded in 1919, on April 15th in London - UK.\n\tPersuadee: Do you work for Save the Children or do you just volunteer for the charity?\nPersuader: I do not work for them, I work on behalf of them. That is why I'm talking to you today. These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you. A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want. Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars. For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.\n\tPersuadee: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question. What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses\nPersuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.\n\tPersuadee: That's pretty impressive! Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.\nPersuader: We do it for them, not for ourselves. And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.\n\tPersuadee: I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is very kind! After this chat is complete, you may choose how ever much you wish to give on the next page. Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.\nPersuader: Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher. It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old. But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.\n\tPersuadee: How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?\nPersuader: As you can see, $1 will change their world. One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about. Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people. This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.\n\tPersuadee: Besides donating and raising awareness, is there any other way I can help Save the Children?\nPersuader: Yes. You can slo sign up & stay connected on our website with your email and phone number. You can also volunteer if you're in the area of any of these children at our program centers. Thank you for donation, there will never be enough people like you in the world!
