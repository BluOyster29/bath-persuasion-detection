Many have said that I am a giving and kind person.\n\tPersuadee: What kind good things do you do for people?\nPersuader: Well, I basically help individuals who are closest to me by helping the elderly with very tasks locally.  I also have a tendency to help children around my neighbor by mentoring some.  I also help with my local congregation by a Godly person as well.\n\tPersuadee: You sound like a very nice and charitable individual. It is a pleasure to meet you!\nPersuader: Well, thank I appreciate your kindness.  I try to do right by people.

What is your purpose? \nPersuader: Well, I believe in our children.  That is reason why I am a part of a cause to help children earth wide.  We are asking for any kind of monetary donation that you may have to help with the cause.\n\tPersuadee: I believe that helping children is a noble cause. How would my donation help these children? \nPersuader: Well, your donation would help on so many levels.  Your donation will help to the overall betterment, improved health, education, and safety of many of these children who come from a developing country.\n\tPersuadee: Why should I help these children? Are they not already being helped?\nPersuader: Well, let me say this.  The children in these countries would like to have additional money provided because still in our modern day, it is still not enough to help.  That is one of the reasons why we are asking for more help.  There are many stories of children who have died from hunger but additional donations would be able to help to quell some of these isolated instances.\n\tPersuadee: That is very compelling. How much of a donation are you asking for?\nPersuader: Well, any amount that you would like to offer would be greatly appreciated.  We like individuals to give from a joyful heart.  So whatever amount that you offer would be greatly appreciated and highly respected by our organization, the Save the Children fund.\n\tPersuadee: I have donated a lot this year to charity but I am able to spare $1 if it means helping children.", "label": [[11, 51, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [94, 131, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [185, 286, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [288, 337, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [406, 510, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [511, 589, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [591, 656, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [764, 803, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [805, 833, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [835, 908, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [997, 1024, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1027, 1063, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [1065, 1092, "1-RAPPORT-COMPLIMENT"], [1095, 1170, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1253, 1285, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1287, 1357, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1359, 1447, "2-NEGOTIATE-REQUEST"], [1566, 1616, "4-LOGIC-OTHER"], [1617, 1767, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [1861, 1883, "8-NO-PERSUASION"], [1885, 2026, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2028, 2088, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2089, 2239, "3-EMOTION-EMPATHY"], [2089, 2239, "1-RAPPORT-DISCLOSE"], [2331, 2406, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2408, 2456, "2-NEGOTIATE-OPINION"], [2408, 2456, "1-RAPPORT-OTHER"], [2458, 2590, "2-NEGOTIATE-BARGAIN"]], "idx": "903"}

I'm excited to be volunteering my time to raise money for a children's charity. It's called Save the Children. \n\tPersuadee: that's great that you volunteer. what kind of activities do you do for the children?\nPersuader: Mostly what I do is try and encourage people to donate what they can to the cause. Save the Children has been around since 1919!  The funds are used to promote children's rights, better their education and health care and also provide emergency aid in situations of natural disaster. \n\tPersuadee: do you know what countries they primarily donate to?\nPersuader: Actually, there a huge number of countries that are helped by Save the Children. It's an international organization. Some of the countries include the U.S., Uganda, Kenya, Peru, and Cambodia. \n\tPersuadee: that is great. i heavily support organizations that help our own united states.\nPersuader: Did you know that, even one year after the destruction caused by hurricane Harvey, Save the Children is still present in Texas helping children to fully recover? It's truly a blessing what they do. Money also goes to provide shelter.  Just 77 cents a day can provide shelter for a refugee family. Do you think Save the Children is a cause that you would consider donating to?\n\tPersuadee: wow I'm heappy to hear that. It's wild the devastation that hurricanes do.\nPersuader: In 2017, 155 million children were helped. There's always more to do though. How would you feel about helping Save the Children by donating some or all of your payment from this task?\n\tPersuadee: i would be willing to donate 10 cents. My charitable donations budget is small because I do a great deal of donating to animal organizations. I love the italian greyhound rescue.\nPersuader: Even 10 cents is helpful. Thank you! That's great that you donate to animal charities. I support PAWS Chicago too. \n\tPersuadee: the snamils need our help just as much as the children do. \nPersuader: No doubt! I just heard about a country does not kill rescue animals in shelters. So every shelter they run is a no-kill shelter. Have you heard that?\n\tPersuadee: i didn't know about that. great to hear it! hopefully more will do the same. I have a 5k to run tomorrow for the italian greyhounds. all proceeds go to the animals.\nPersuader: Good for you! Wow, that's great!  It's nice when volunteers can act in other ways in addition to giving money. Especially since not everyone has the money to give. \n\tPersuadee: right. I like to donate my time in addition to money. charitable giving is a good thing to do.\nPersuader: Well thank you for offering 10 cents from this task to Save the Children.

As a matter of fact, the world has made great progress for children. More children are alive and thriving today than ever before. But here's the problem. Millions of children in the U.S. and around the world still aren't getting what they deserve. We're talking about children in need. Dying, when the world knows how to save them. Vulnerable children in poverty. Denied an education. Forced to flee violence. Orphaned, abused, abandoned. Children with no reason to smile. No hope for the future.  The world's children deserve better.\n\tPersuadee: is there any cons to donating\nPersuader: For donor, there is no direct cons to donating. However, through the power of Sponsorship, you help ensure a child in need has the best chance for success _ with a healthy start, the opportunity to learn and protection from harm. Our innovative Sponsorship programs address the unique needs of children where they live.\n\tPersuadee: is there a minimum amount that i must donate \nPersuader: No, there isn't.

Your donation would be essential to help ensure children's rights to health, education, and safety. Your donation will make a tangible impact for the world.\n\tPersuadee: Is this the charity that they want us to donate?\nPersuader: Yes, we would be ever so happy if you want to donate to this charity.

What is an amount you are comfortable donating?\n\tPersuadee: Is this a mutual donation, from both of us.

Of course, Your $2 would make the most difference to these neglected children.\n\tPersuadee: I am willing to donate $1.  That seems to be fair to all.\nPersuader: Thank you so much for your generosity! The children of our organization will be so fortunate and happy to receive this.

That would make me happy to help.\nPersuader: We are so happy that you are helping as well. The children will really benefit from this. Last year, many children died from hunger because we did not get enough donations to fully feed their families. Even small amounts of change can mean the difference between life or death for the little ones. Is there any way you could consider going to $1.50? I just spoke with my manager and wonderful news! She said the charity would STILL be willing to match if you go up just that small increment!\n\tPersuadee: I love helping the children.

I just got in to work so we will see how things go today!\nPersuader: Hopefully it will be a good day :) Do you mind if I ask what kind of work you do?\n\tPersuadee: I actually work for a local television station in the middle of America.\nPersuader: Oh wow that sounds fantastic! Were you ever involved in raising awareness about social issues? Like children in need?\n\tPersuadee: I've donated to a few charities before, but I've never been personally involved myself.\nPersuader: I think you have a great platform for raising awareness so more people can donate to the cause\n\tPersuadee: That's true. I supposed I am in a good position. Unfortunately, I kind of just have a desk job, and don't really have anything to do with the news that is broadcast.\nPersuader: Well nothing is lost there, you can maybe persuade some co-workers to bring it up higher in the chain. A few years back I was in India and even though I was mesmerized by the beauty of its rich culture I was overly sad to see many children in the streets who looked utterly malnutritioned and were begging in the streets. It broke my heart. So much so that I got involved with a few charities to help children around the world.\n\tPersuadee: Oh that's great!! I wish I had more time to travel and more money to give. I love the feeling when you know you're actually helping someone else.\nPersuader: Its a great feeling. Especially now that I myself am a parent, I get even more depressed to see that in 2018, there are millions of children who suffer especially those in war zones. But you know, every little cent helps. You don't have to give hundreds or thousands. I have also worked in Baghdad during the war, and there were children in the streets selling packs of gum just to get a few cents here and there so they can survive.\n\tPersuadee: Oh my God. That's truly awful to know that children have to experience that. I would love to find a way to donate, even if it was just a little bit.\nPersuader: Have you heard of \"Save the Children\" Charity? They do amazing wo? It only takes 77c a day to help provide shelter for refugees. They have many programs that you can participate in to help out.  \n\tPersuadee: Oh that's awesome!! What kind of programs do they provide?\nPersuader: They target many causes. They provide education to teach children important skills. They also provide the best health and nutrition programs. They have a protection program and even programs for natural disaster areas. Imagine if 77c a day can provide shelter what would $1 or $2 dollars do?\n\tPersuadee: That's such a good point. Unfortunately, I'm in a really bad position monetarily right now. Is there any way I could donate even just a little bit?\nPersuader: You are very kind, but like I said every little thing helps. How much would you feel comfortable to donate to the charity?\n\tPersuadee: Maybe 20 cents? I know that's not a lot, but it's all I can afford for the next couple days.\nPersuader: Can you make it maybe 77c? Atleast you will feel good knowing that you are helping in providing shelter to these poor refugees.Your donation will be direclt deducted from your task payment but imagine what 77c would do for a child with no home...\n\tPersuadee: OK, I can donate 77 ceents\nPersuader: Perfect!!!!!! Thank you so so much! Imagine what a great gift you have just provided. May you be blessed always!

How many people around the world help this organization?\nPersuader: Last year, Save the Children helped to provide education, food, shelter, and other basic necessities for more than 155 million children worldwide.\n\tPersuadee: Wow, that is amazing! \nPersuader: I'm sure you are aware that throughout the world there are millions of children who lack access to basic needs like food, clean water, good clothing, and education. Save the Children works to help those kids, so that they can grow up to be healthy, happy, and productive adults.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I am aware. Its truly sad that children are suffering like that. I am truly thankful for organizations like Save the Children are around to help these children out and bless families! \nPersuader: I'm also glad that organizations like Save the Children are out there making a difference. As I'm sure you also know, Save the Children is reliant on donations to be able to provide the help they do.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I know. I often get asked to help out different organizations when checking out at grocery stores and majority of the time I do!\nPersuader: That's great! I'd like you to know that if you choose to donate to Save the Children, they are a top-rated charity. Last year, 86% of all donated funds went directly into programs to help needy children. \n\tPersuadee: Glad to hear they are top rated! What happens to the other percentage that does not go to the program?\nPersuader: About 5% goes to administration costs, while about 9% is spent on fundraising efforts. \n\tPersuadee: That makes sense. Fundraising is definitely important in getting the word out so that money can be raised for the children.\nPersuader: Would you be willing to make a small donation today? Every little bit helps, and even a donation as small as $1 can go a long way to help in some of the areas where Save the Children provides aid.\n\tPersuadee: I would definitely love to help. Could I do anything under $1.00 like maybe 50 cents? \nPersuader: Of course! Donations in any amount are welcome.\n\tPersuadee: Great! I would love to donate 50 cents. I wish I had more but unfortunately I dont at this time. \nPersuader: I understand. But I really appreciate you donating what you can afford.

It\\'s fun to say, \"Hey, I participated in that study\"\n\tPersuadee: Yeah I like doing the Product review type HITs and the ones where you have to watch a video  \nPersuader: Those are pretty good. My favorite one so far has been recording my voice saying various words for a study on accents in speech. Then hearing the results on a news story about 6 months later... pretty satisfying.\n\tPersuadee: That sounds interesting.

{"id": 2440, "data": "Persuader: Hi, have you ever heard of the charity \"Save the Children\" before?\n\tPersuadee: No I havent, please tell me more.\nPersuader: Save the Children is a charity organization that provides funding to help get children access to health and education all over the world  \n\tPersuadee: That sounds great.  I think any childrens charity that is legitimate is worthy.  I am a big fan of St Jude's, I like the fact that they treat children but are also looking for a cure for diseases.\nPersuader: Yeah St Jude's is a great organization that helps find cures for diseases.  There are a lot of other emergencies out there besides disease though, like disasters caused by weather or conflict and Save The Children provides money to help kids affected by that\n\tPersuadee: So the organization just funds local clinics but does not have any personal effect on treating children?\nPersuader: Save the Children definitely has an effect on treating kids, they are active in over 120 countries and as well as providing funding to local organizations they also give direct aid like emergency supplies after a disaster. So they really can do it either way.  \n\tPersuadee: I feel so silly! Is \"Save the Children\" that organization that I see commercials for that shows sad underweight children with swollen tummies and says for the price of a cup of coffee each day you can sponsor a child.  Those are heartwrenching\nPersuader: Yeah those commercials can be persuasive, there are so many different disasters affecting kids all over the world. The food insecurity in Africa is off the charts whenever there is a drought and Save the Children helps provide food to starving kids there. Any donation can really help provide more food.\n\tPersuadee: Thats wonderful, I definitely support helping those children.  I guess I dont think too much about them day to day, I kind of get consumed by the homelessness here in my city, or what our local church is funding at the moment.  But starving children deserve more wherever they are.  Its sad that we can never do enough\nPersuader: Yeah its hard because wll live in such a connected world that you hear about so many awful things going on. On the positive side though in the past all of these awful things were happening but there were less mechanisms to help stop it. But for example this week thousands were displaced in Somali because of flooding but now Save the Children along with other organizations will go over there to help them.\n\tPersuadee: Thats great, what is their website so I can look more into it?\nPersuader:  URL here you go\n\tPersuadee: Thank you! Do you also sponsor children yourself?\nPersuader: I have but not directly with Save the Children, I have been active in other organizations though like Boys and Girls Club\n\tPersuadee: oh, thats a great organization also.  I always wondered if the kids really write letters, that would be really neat.\nPersuader: Some do, but the sponsorship isn't just for a specific child it just goes into a fund. The kids write letters to people who put money into the fund. That allows them greater flexibility to move money around to where its needed\n\tPersuadee: Oh ok, well thats a shame.  But I am not discounting the cause.\nPersuader: I think it really is more of a positive because if someone was to donate but later on in life they had to pause their donation for a time for some reason or another they wouldn't feel morally responsible for that child no longer being supported, because their would be other donors in the fund that would pick up the slack. \n\tPersuadee: That makes a lot of sense.

I thought it was an interesting idea. Plus sometimes I\\'m just lazy and that\\'s an easy uncomplicated way to do it.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, i do like that concept. However, I often wonder what a big difference it would really make\nPersuader: Remember that ice bucket challenge thing that was super popular a while back? I thought it was fun but wouldn't do anything productive. Turns out they raised so much money it some drug trial through and they've found a drug that helps and is now on the market and that just blew me away. Downside of course is people still have to part with money they already had. I donated some of my reward to the charity because it wasn't really out of my pocket and I guess I figured every little bit might help.\n\tPersuadee: Oh wow, I never knew that! That is amazing what a difference we can make without thinking it would really make one\nPersuader: I know and besides it got my son to dump a bucket of ice water on himself which was just hilarious.\n\tPersuadee: That is funny! Honestly, before the challenge I never even heard about ALS, so I guess it did its job by spreading awareness\nPersuader: That's really true. Maybe on top of people not wanting the rigamarole of the donation process sometimes all we need is a better understanding of the need or just faith that a little from everyone can go a long way. \n\tPersuadee: Yea, maybe more challenges can be done to spread awareness to diseases that often go unnoticed or unheard of\nPersuader: Yeah, maybe, people just need information, ease of donating, and a sense of community about it all. This HIT we are doing is kind of doing the same thing as that other survey I did. We both get our base pay and then can choose to keep the added incentive or donate a portion of it to the charity Save the Children. I was contemplating giving some of mine away. I've worked overseas with kids through medical clinics and have seen how far what we think of as a small amount of money can really go.\n\tPersuadee: Yes, I am willing to donate a portion to the charity\nPersuader: I was going to donate half of mine. Some for me for the work and some for them in the hopes it helps.

Out of curiousity, have you heard of the organization Save the Children?\n\tPersuadee: yes..i am very familiar..are you involved with charity\nPersuader: Yes! I really prefer local charities but some nationwide and international ones are very dear to my heart. Whenever we have the opportunity to donate from our task rewards I always try to give a little bit.\n\tPersuadee: me too..i see many commercials for charity on TV and it breaks my heart.. i am also a follower of Unicef, are you familiar\nPersuader: Yes, I've heard of Unicef. Another great organization. One thing I love about Save the Children is that they have very high ratings from third-party reportings. I know when I donate to them that my money is being used wisely!\n\tPersuadee: interesting, what do the ratings represent\nPersuader: The ratings are from different companies such as Better Business Bureau and American Institute of Philanthropy. They actually get the financial reports from the IRS to confirm the accuracy in where the funds are going.\n\tPersuadee: very good...are you interested in other charities involved with children\nPersuader: I have given to other organizations in the past, such as World Vision, but Save the Children is really important to me right now. There is such a lack of support right now in developing countries, and Save the Children really focuses on that.\n\tPersuadee: i happen to favor unicef since my kids collect for halloween and kids count monies as part of class project.\nPersuader: I totally understand that. One thing I like about Save the Children is that it isn't just global but also focuses on kids in need here in the USA, especially the poverty-torn cities.\n\tPersuadee: i tend to give up to 100$ a month to children's org- what is your prefered donation?\nPersuader: I typically give less than that, because I also give to my local church and other local organizations in my city.\n\tPersuadee: ah..what do you consider a fair donation per month\nPersuader: Well, I just usually give $20 or $30 to a handful of charities that I love. But like I said, if the opportunity arises for me to donate some of my HIT reward to a charity, I will usually donate at least a small portion. Do you ever do that?\n\tPersuadee: i tend to give to people on the street asking for $$..there lots of opp...20 to 30 is fair amount\nPersuader: You actually have the opportunity today to donate a portion of your task payment to Save the Children. How much would you like to put towards that? It can be any amount from just $0.10 to the full payment!\n\tPersuadee: hmm..interesting i will consider that..how would i contact them\nPersuader: The research team will collect all donations and send it directly to Save the Children.

How much of the charity donation goes directly to helping them?\nPersuader: 9 out of every 10 dollars... a good percentage for a charity organization\n\tPersuadee: What kind of services do they offer to the children? Do they have staff or volunteers that go over to help directly, or do they just send supplies?\nPersuader: They have their own aid workers for certain projects, and other projects are about supplies.  They have aid workers that help in disaster, but they also send food baskets to kids in war zones.  There are several different relief programs their money goes to.\n\tPersuadee: I would be willing to donate 1 dollar \nPersuader: That's excellent.  Your donation will be pulled directly from your task payment.  The research team is sending all the donations directly to Save The Children.  Do you have any other questions since we have to do 10 messages each for the task?\n\tPersuadee: I do not have any more questions\nPersuader: Cool.  Thank you for donating a dollar.

How about you?\nPersuader: This is 3rd task for the day.  I haven't been on long either.  I've only been doing this about a month.  You?\n\tPersuadee: A little over a month. I just hit 500 a couple of days ago.\nPersuader: Nice.  I had a 1c hit that you could do a lot of times, so I used it to boost my numbers.  I'm a little over 1000.  I'm doing $5-10 a day roughy.\n\tPersuadee: Same here. I usually try to keep my tasks at 50c and above. I'm paranoid about doing a lot of small hits and getting hundreds of rejections lol\nPersuader: I use HitForker (look it up).  I set my tasks for 50c or higher and pluck them from there to go into my Panda thing.  There's a ton of browser extensions and sites to help.  Facebook groups too.  Thank you for donating $1 to this.  When you send your 10th message, I'm sure it will give you the option to do that. :)\n\tPersuadee: I use HITscraper.

In the first two months of 2018 alone, 1,000 children were reportedly killed or injured in intensifying violence. \n\tPersuadee: I see so does the money go for food, shelter, medical support those kinds of things?\nPersuader: exactly. The war torn area is just one of many examples of places where kids need support. It's great to help. every little bit counts!\n\tPersuadee: Does this money provide help for the kids in their own country or is it used to bring these children over to the United States?\nPersuader: to help in their countries. They also help kids here in the USA too. would you consider making a donation? even something small would help.\n\tPersuadee: I'm sorry I'm just not able to at this time but thank you for telling me about this organization. I wish you well.\nPersuader: Even 1 penny? 1 penny would be minimal and would greatly help.\n\tPersuadee: Alright, I will donate 25 cents.\nPersuader: wow! thanks on behalf of the organization! that is generous! \n\tPersuadee: You're very welcome.\nPersuader: what else do you have planned for the labor day?\n\tPersuadee: We went out with family to eat and are just taking it easy and yourself?\nPersuader: going out to eat is always a fun way to spend time together. I went to the movies to see crazy rich asians. It was good.\n\tPersuadee: It sounds like fun.

That is why I'm talking to you today. These children need help, and could use it from generous people like you. A meal, an education, an opportunity like everyone else, that is all these kids want. Even one cent will add up to help a child in need, but if you wish you may donate up to 2 dollars. For every cent you donate it will come directly from your task payment.\n\tPersuadee: I love to help charities that serve a good cause and I would love to donate but I do have one question. What is the portion of donations that goes to children versus the portion that goes to administration or other expenses\nPersuader: Sure, absolutely. In 2017, 86% went to Program services - or services that directly help aid these children. 9% went towards fundraising efforts, and 5% went towards our Management & other general costs. In 2018 we anticipate similar numbers.\n\tPersuadee: That's pretty impressive! Not too many charities can claim such a strong commitment to the cause.\nPersuader: We do it for them, not for ourselves. And we hope our numbers reflect that amount of love and effort that goes toward what we do.\n\tPersuadee: I'd be willing to donate $1 to Save the Children.\nPersuader: That is very kind! After this chat is complete, you may choose how ever much you wish to give on the next page. Would you like to know about a potential child this money would be helping?\n\tPersuadee: Sure, tell me more about a potential child this money would help.\nPersuader: Mim, in Bangladesh is 7 years old, and wants to become a teacher. It could go towards her education, because in her country the average girl only stays in school until 10 years old. But more likely, it will be going towards meals or daily living expenses, with the average parent from her country only earning $3 a day.\n\tPersuadee: How much does a $1 dollar donation change a child like Mim's situation?\nPersuader: As you can see, $1 will change their world. One more meal or a pair of shoes will be one less thing that Mim, and her parents need to worry about. Bangladesh has been one of the largest parts of that Rohingya refugee exodus from Myanmar that I mentioned before and have been struggling themselves taking on more than 655,000 extra people. This has caused further hardship on an already hardened country.\n\tPersuadee: Besides donating and raising awareness, is there any other way I can help Save the Children?\nPersuader: Yes. You can slo sign up & stay connected on our website with your email and phone number. You can also volunteer if you're in the area of any of these children at our program centers. Thank you for donation, there will never be enough people like you in the world!
