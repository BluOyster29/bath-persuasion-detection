"Food pantries? A lot of food worldwide comes from countries such as Zimbabwe or Haiti (countries that work with Save the Children). Right now there's famine, but by donating it will ultimately increase the worldwide food, and reduce the need for food pantries as a whole. Even though it's marketed at children, it's moreso helping the areas that have a high child poverty rate",4-LOGIC,1,4-LOGIC
" but countries like Italy or Japan are experiencing a population shift. Even in countries like USA and France, more doctors and scientists are retiring than graduating. So we need kids to supplement all of those areas",4-LOGIC,1,4-LOGIC
So we need kids to supplement all of those areas,4-LOGIC,1,4-LOGIC
" In France tuition is not as expensive as in USA. There is a lack of population from 18-24, and there's even less of a population below 15. In Japan, the birthrate is low so keeping children is key as the population retires more. Children are the future work force, and help countries run economically and socially.
